Hello world!!!
After starting to overcome some mental health issues it felt right to create a blog and to share my voice.
I had an issue with keeping up with projects and maintaining them so instead of starting with a designed
blog website I am going to enhance as I progress.

## Who am I

My name is Mikey and I have been around the web since the XHTML and Flash era. Alot has changed just as I have.
For a long time I felt my voice didn't matter and had low self esteem but I have found that a blog will help me
in this situation. Documenting what I learn for myself and anyone who finds it helps is great.
